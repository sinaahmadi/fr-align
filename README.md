# Alignment of French Resources

This repository contains resources and codes to run experiments on aligning the *[TrÃ©sor de la Langue FranÃ§aise informatisÃ©](https://www.atilf.fr/ressources/tlfi/)* and the French Wiktionary -- [Wiktionnaire](https://fr.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionnaire:Page_d%E2%80%99accueil).

## Data Extraction
In addition to [codes/main.py](codes/main.py), two of the provided scripts can be used within other applications and are described as follows:

- [codes/dbnary.py](codes/dbnary.py) retrieves data from Wiktionnaire through [DBnary](http://kaiko.getalp.org/about-dbnary/)'s SPARQL endpoint
- [codes/tlfi.py](codes/tlfi.py) extracts relevant information from TLFi by reaching out to specific tags and paths in the XML files. To reduce complexity in the hierarchy of senses, all senses are flattened and provided at the same level. Extraction of definitions was particularly challenging due to lack of distinction between the definition of the entry versus that of the locution/idioms which also appear in the same entry. For example, *mur* (noun) comes with over 60 definitions in (TLFi)[https://www.cnrtl.fr/definition/mur] among which only a couple of them define the entry and the other, focus on locutions, idioms or multi-word expressions as in "*mur des Lamentations, des Pleurs.*" and "*mur ossaturÃ©*".

In both resources, the microstructure of each entry is reshaped as follows:

- *puissamment* from TLFi (See [https://www.cnrtl.fr/definition/PUISSAMMENT])

```
{
    "gender": "",
    "id": "69866",
    "lemma": "puissamment",
    "pos": "adverb",
    "senses": {
        "A.": "TrÃ¨s, Ã  un degrÃ© Ã©levÃ©, avec force.",
        "B.": "Avec efficacitÃ©, grandement.",
        "C.": "Avec de la force physique; de faÃ§on marquÃ©e.",
        "D.": "Avec des moyens puissants, fortement."
    }
} 
```

- *puissamment* from Wiktionnaire (See [https://fr.wiktionary.org/wiki/puissamment])

```
{
    "http://kaiko.getalp.org/dbnary/fra/puissamment__adv__1": {
        "lemma": "puissamment",
        "pos": "adverb",
        "gender": "",
        "senses": {
            "http://kaiko.getalp.org/dbnary/fra/__ws_2_puissamment__adv__1": "Avec force.",
            "http://kaiko.getalp.org/dbnary/fra/__ws_4_puissamment__adv__1": "(Par extension) trÃ¨s.",
            "http://kaiko.getalp.org/dbnary/fra/__ws_1_puissamment__adv__1": "Avec puissance.",
            "http://kaiko.getalp.org/dbnary/fra/__ws_3_puissamment__adv__1": "ExtrÃªmement."
        }
    }
}
```

## Data Annotation

Based on the lemmata used in the [MWSA datasets](https://github.com/elexis-eu/mwsa) (which are based on the English WordNet), we retrieve the synsets associated to the word in the French language based the Open Multilingual WordNet. The is beneficial to carry out cross-lingual word-sense alignment tasks in the future.

The relevant information are then extracted for these words in French as described in the previous section. Given a lemma with identical part-of-speech and gender in TLFi and Wiktionnaire, a combination of all possible definition/sense matches are provided. This way, the annotator can select one of the following relations between every pair of senses in the two resources:
- `none`: the two senses/definitions are not referring to the same concepts, i.e. meanings
- `exact`: the two senses/definitions are semantically identical
- `related`: the two senses/definitions are not referring to the same concepts but are **semantically related**

Here are a few examples:

- `livre` (noun, masculine)

    - proposed relation: **`related`**
        - *Ouvrage imprimÃ©, reliÃ© ou brochÃ©, non pÃ©riodique, comportant un assez grand nombre de pages.* (TLF)
        - *Ouvrage qui fait rÃ©fÃ©rence Ã  un texte sacrÃ©* (Wiktionnaire) 
    - proposed relation: **`exact`**
        - *Assemblage de feuilles en nombre plus ou moins Ã©levÃ©, portant des signes destinÃ©s Ã  Ãªtre lus.* (TLF)
        - *Assemblage de feuilles manuscrites ou imprimÃ©es destinÃ©es Ã  Ãªtre lues.* (Wiktionnaire) 
    - proposed relation: **`none`**
        - *Ouvrage constituant un volume imprimÃ©. * (TLF)
        - *Registre destinÃ© Ã  recueillir les signatures et les commentaires des visiteurs.* (Wiktionnaire) 

These type of relations are based on [SKOS's semantic relations](https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/#semantic-relations). It should be noted that the proposed relations are symmetric. Therefore, `R(A, B)` equals with `R(B, A)`, where `R()` refers to the relation between `A` and `B`. 

ðŸ†• (update on Sep. 15th) Given the complexity of some sense distinctions, particularly those that may be annotated as **`related`** or **`exact`**, we follow the definitions of exact and related according to [SKOS Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS)](https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference). Based on this data model, **`related`** and **`exact`** are respectively equivalent to `skos:related` and `skos:exactMatch`. The followings shows the hierarchy of properties in this data model:

![SKOS mapping properties](SKOS_mapping_properties.png)

Therefore, other types of semantic relations, such as `broader` and `narrower` can be considered as `related` as they are subclasses of that property (not to be confused with `skos:relatedMatch`). According to [Section 10.6.1. in the reference](https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/#mapping), mapping properties `skos:broadMatch`, `skos:narrowMatch` and `skos:relatedMatch` are provided for a more fine-grained organization of concepts arguing that:

> The rationale behind this design is that it is hard to draw an absolute distinction between internal links within a concept scheme and mapping links between concept schemes. This is especially true in an open environment where different people might re-organize concepts into concept schemes in different ways. What one person views as two concept schemes with mapping links between, another might view as one single concept scheme with internal links only. This specification allows both points of view to co-exist, which (it is hoped) will promote flexibility and innovation in the re-use of SKOS data in the Web. 

<!-- In order to evaluate the level of (dis)agreement among annotators, we will then calculate an inter-annotator agreement such as [Fleis's Kappa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fleiss%27_kappa). -->


## Inter-annotator agreement

As of September 15th, Krippendorff's alpha for the two datasets of the two groups of annotators is as follows:
    - Group 1 (annotated by Mathieu, Hee-Soo and Bruno): **0.29**. 228 pairs of definitions are annotated.
    - Group 2 (annotated by Karen and Sina): **0.39**. 227 pairs of definitions are annotated.

The following figure illustrates heatmaps of how each two annotators perform comparatively:
